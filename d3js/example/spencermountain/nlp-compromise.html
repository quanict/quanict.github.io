Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys that made them so violent?
Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours.
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine.
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time.

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly.
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore.
I don't care what they say about us anyway, I don't care bout that.

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near I know that you need help.
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit, you need a guardian.
Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours.
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine.
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time.

Bang, bang a knock on the door.
Another big bang and you're down on the floor.
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe.
I can't run and I can't kick.
What's a matter babe are you feeling sick?
what's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter babe, are you feeling blue? oh-oh!
And that's for all time.`;
